# Tailwind Practice

Learning Tailwind using [Tailwind CSS From Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/tailwind-from-scratch/) as a starting point, which incorporates project ideas from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home). 

All pages are fully responsive. Some projects do have a little bit of vanilla JS sprinkled in. Will be adding more examples soon.

`./setup.sh` can be used to initialise a new empty project.
