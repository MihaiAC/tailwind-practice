# Learning Tailwind

Learning Tailwind using [Tailwind CSS From Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/tailwind-from-scratch/) as a starting point, which incorporates project ideas from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home). All pages are fully responsive.

Setup the environment with `./setup.sh`.

Some non-SVG images have been omitted to save space.
